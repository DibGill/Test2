# keys can be quoted, and it is useful if putting ':' in key
literal_block: |
  This entire block of text will be the value of the literal_block key, with line breaks being preserved.

  The literal continues until de-dented, and the leading indentation is stripped.

    Any lines that are more-indented keep the rest of the indentation -
    these lines will be indented by 4 spaces
folded_style: >
  This entier block of text will be the value of 'folded_style', but this time, all newlines will be replaced with a single space. 

  Blank lines, like above, are converted to a newline charcter

    more-indented lines keep their newlines, too-
    this text appears on two lines
